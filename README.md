# SSI_research
This is a reserach project done over the summer of 2020. Advice, the results should be taken with 2 mines of salt. This is no means a real and proper paper you should reference. 

The PDF is the written report with all you need to know(aka methodology, results and the very "conclusive" discussion). All the code that was written is in the other folder. I have not sorted it out at all. I hope the name is enough for you to distinguish the usage.
